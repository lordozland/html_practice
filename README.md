# html_practice
Just finished HTML course in LinkedIn and want to practice.  

A lot of the coding from this comes from Jen Simmons' html class and from the associated repository.  Just practicing, sandboxing and relearning basic html. 


March 2, 2023:  I think this is moving towards a new portfolio.  Probably will expand to React.js at some point, but mostly using this to explore LinkedIn Classes, new ideas and portfolio direction.
